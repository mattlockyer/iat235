    <h2>Assignment 3: HTML Structure</h2>
   
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>For this assignment you will be building out some sample code for your item detail sections (when a user is looking at a specific item). We will be expecting a series of elements (see list below) <em>with no styling</em> which may mean they look very similar at this point <em>and that is ok</em>. This assignment expects you to explore further semantic HTML5 tags, for which we highly recommend <a href="http://html5doctor.com/#glossary" target="_blank">HTML5 Doctor</a></p>
