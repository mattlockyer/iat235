    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
    <p>Please note the following wireframing rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>use a clear grid structure</li>
        <li>no branded elements are to be included (placeholders only)</li>
        <li>only shades of grey, one orange, one blue, black and white are permitted for colours</li>
        <li>only different weights of Arial is permitted</li>
        <li>different pages should link to one-another appropriately   </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Steps to completing the assignment:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Create <strong>3-5 pages of wireframes in Draw.io / Axure</strong> demonstrating the screens a user might encounter while posting an item in your section on Craigslist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are including <strong>real text</strong> in your wireframes (no Lorem Ipsum)</li>
            <li>Your wireframes must allow us to navigate between steps (using IMG MAPS)</li>
        </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Create notes</strong> on each of the wireframes that help illustrate how you are fulfilling functional and content specifications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The notes should identify specific specifications, and how the wireframes are demonstrating fulfilling them</li>
            <li>Ensure the notes are embedded on the appropriate pages within the wireframes</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p>
            <strong>Put all HTML files into a folder</strong> for your submission, and <strong>ZIP the FOLDER</strong> into a single zip file.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Put this on your SIAT website</strong> and bring the link to your wireframes to lab for critique.   </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
