    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>Working with our Project 1 materials from prior weeks you will be building an information architecture using a couple different approaches to understand what will be needed from your website.</p>
    <h3 id="due">Due</h3>
    <p>Before <strong>LAB 04</strong></p>
    <h3 id="worth">Worth</h3>
    <p>5% of your final grade</p>
    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
    
    
    <ol>
    <li><p>Create an information architecture that illustrates the use case of<strong>posting an item/event/activity</strong>. This should be a <em>top-down</em> structure that includes: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>exploring what is needed from the use case (from the user's side)</li>
        <li>covering how a user might begin to approach it or understand it</li>
        <li><em>not about building a sitemap</em>, but organizing task information into linked categories</li>
        <li>think about the user and how they are meant to flow through the task</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: a user has posted a single image, where do they return to after?</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Create an information architecture that illustrates the structure of the <strong>section you are posting in</strong> This should be a <em>bottom-up</em> structure.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sub Categories</li>
    <li>Search</li>
    <li>Posting</li>
    <li>Navigation Options</li>
    <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Include the item detail, every possible component and how this is organized</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Title
    <li>Subtitle</li>
    <li>Location</li>
    <li>Map</li>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h2 id="final-delivery">Final Delivery - TO BE HANDED IN</h2>
    <p>Final deliverables are due to Canvas <strong>before your lab time on Week 4</strong>. Please remember that <strong>professionalism in your submission</strong> is important:</p>
    <ul>
    
    <li><p>Create <strong>1 final document</strong> using a vector graphics program (i.e. Draw.io or Illustrator) that shows the <em>top-down and bottom-up architectures</em> separately. We are looking for clean, clear and effective presentations of both architectures.</p>
    </li>
    
    </ul>
    <h4 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h4>
    <p>Each requirement receives points as outlined:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Effective top-down information architecture (1.5 pts)</li>
    <li>Effective bottom-up information architecture (1.5 pts)</li>
    <li>Design quality (2 pts)</li>
    </ul>
