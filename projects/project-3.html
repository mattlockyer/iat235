    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>Continuing from Project 2 in this project a responsive web coded demo of <strong>your redesigned Craigslist section</strong></p>
    
    <p>You will be required to build out the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>listings of items</li>
      <li>navigation to different views and subsections</li>
      <li>posting an item</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Even though your website might not functionally perform all these actions, your final submission must allow the user to experience:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>a clear overview of available items, views, subsections and navigation</li>
      <li>be able to post an item and preview their post</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Any links that do not have accompanying pages should link back to your section and a default view</em>.   </p>

    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
    <p>There are a number of weeks in which to complete this project, please pay attention to what is required from you <strong>individually</strong> as your process grade will be influenced by it. </p>
    
    <p>This project differs in that we will be focusing on <strong>code and content</strong> for the first few weeks and then <strong>design and usability</strong> in the later weeks. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>As a group, build out all of your HTML pages</strong>. Once done building them out, ensure they validate (this will be checked in the lab next week). <em>Use real content</em>.</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Individually</strong>, <strong>style these pages</strong> using CSS. <strong>Do not</strong> worry about responsive layouts and fine detail positioning of elements, though ensure the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Basic page structure (nav, layout, main)</li>
          <li>Initial ideas for typography, borders, hierarchy, color</li>
          <li>There is only one CSS file for all pages</li>
          <li>You have a clean file and folder structure</li>
          <li>That your CSS validates (will be checked in lab)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Individually</strong>, <strong>identify what content is needed</strong>. This list should include:
        <ul>
          <li>what kinds of photos or images might be necessary</li>
          <li>what icons might be used</li>
          <li>any maps or information visuals that might be required</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Individually</strong>, from your list of content <strong>compile the image content</strong> you require as needed (some options listed below). Try use realistice photos that would represent items correctly.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project (Icons)</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons Search</a></li>
