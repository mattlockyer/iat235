    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>Continuing from Project 1, in this project we will be building a <strong>structure for searching and posting an item</strong> on Craigslist Vancouver.</p>
    
    <p>You will be required to build out the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>an overview of your section with a listing of subsections</li>
      <li>a navigation stucture that allows jumping to different sections and viewing listings in each section with a variety of navigation techniques</li>
      <li>an item detail section</li>
      <li>posting an item to your section</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Even though you will not necessarily build out all of these sections, your navigation for the website must presume that the user will need to be able to:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>get a clear overview of available sections subsections and items</li>
      <li>be able to understand how to search for an item</li>
      <li>can complete the posting of an item</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><em>Any links that do not have accompanying pages should link back to the home-page</em>.</p>

    <p>20% of your final grade.   </p>
    
    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
    
    <p>There are a number of weeks in which to complete this project, please pay attention to what is required from you <strong>individually</strong> as your process grade will be influenced by it.   </p>
    
    <h3 id="week-3">Part 1</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>As a group</strong> build out <strong>one main sitemap</strong> illustrating the entirety of the site. It should provide us with a clear understanding of:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>hierarchy of pages</li>
          <li>linking between pages</li>
          <li>relationship and association of pages   </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>As a group, fill out the <a href="https://canvas.sfu.ca/courses/21545/files/2708637/">Project 2 contract</a></strong> available on Canvas.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Individually</strong>, create <strong>vector based rendered wireframes (using draw.io)</strong> illustrating the hierarchy of each of the pages on your sitemap. There will be some common pages, only create one wireframe for these. The wireframes should:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> only create 1 wireframe page to represent the subsections: technology, outdoors, kitchen, etc... (they will all look the same)</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>use a grid structure</li>
          <li>help us see general hierarchy on the pages</li>
          <li>what elements of the structure will be common</li>
          <li>what elements of the structure will change   </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Part 1 - Due in Lab 04</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 set of VECTOR (Draw.io/Axure) wireframes for all pages (per individual)</li>
      <li>1 sitemap, printed (per group)   </li>
      <li>1 contract, printed (per group)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br />
    
    <h3 id="week-4">Part 2</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Individually</strong>, generate <strong>a flowchart</strong> illustrating the process of completing one of posting an item. Ensure that your flowchart SHOWS THE FOLLOWING:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ORDER of user ACTIONS</li>
          <li>WHAT DECISIONS the user can make and their outcomes</li>
          <li>WHAT user INPUT is needed, and WHEN</li>
          <li>HOW they will complete the task</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Individually</strong>, generate <strong>a set of higher-fidelity VECTOR wireframes</strong> illustrating how the different screens may look for the flow-chart you just created. It is required that these wireframes:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>use a grid structure</li>
          <li>illustrate key interaction points and actual text for headings and labels</li>
          <li>demonstrate a clear hierarchy of content   </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Part 2 - Due in Lab 5</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 flowchart, printed (per individual)</li>
      <li>1 set of screen wireframes (related to the flowchart), PDF Submission on Canvas (per individual)</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <br />
    
    
    
    <h3 id="week-5">Part 3</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>As a group</strong> create <strong>1 finalized sitemap and flowchart</strong> (PDF) based on the feedback you have received.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>As a group</strong> create <strong>2 sets of interactive wireframes using IMG MAP HTML tags</strong>  and then submitted in a single folder ZIPPED up. One set must be for a <em>desktop display</em> (1280px wide), while the other set must be for a <em>smartphone display</em> (480px wide). <strong>Note the following rules to avoid grade deductions</strong>:</p>
    
        <ul>
          <li>use a clear grid structure</li>
          <li>only build the pages listed at the top of the brief</li>
          <li>no branded elements are to be included (placeholders only)</li>
          <li>only shades of grey, one orange, one blue, black and white are permitted for colours</li>
          <li>only different weights of Arial is permitted</li>
          <li>different pages should link to one-another appropriately   </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>As a group</strong> prepare a <strong>2 minute presentation</strong> that illustrates how your site will collapse effectively, and help the user complete the chosen use case.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Submit all materials to Canvas, and bring your prepared presentation to lab.   </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    
    
    
    <h2 id="final-delivery">Final Delivery</h2>
    <p>Due to Canvas <strong>before your Lab 06</strong>. All items should be <strong>clearly labelled with your names</strong> and please remember that professionalism in your submission is important. Grades will be deducted for submissions lacking in required information or quality.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>1 finalized sitemap and flowchart for the chosen activities (PDF)</li>
      <li>2 final set of wireframes, for desktop and mobile (generated to HTML, submitted in ZIP) </li>
      <li>1 set of presentation slides, presented in lab</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <h3 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h3>
    <p>Your project is worth 20% of your final grade, with the grade being distributed amongst the following categories:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Followed the Rules (2 pts)</li>
