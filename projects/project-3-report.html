    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>Based on your final project you will be required to provide <strong>well researched design rationale</strong> for  your final IA and User Experience.</p>
    
    <p>The purpose of this report is to articulate to your clients (TAs and myself) your design decisions, using the design, information architecture, user experience and technical material covered in this course.</p>
